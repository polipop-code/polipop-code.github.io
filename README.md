Hello there, this is my personal portfolio and here I applied most of
my knowledge about HTML and CSS.

Starting from `<HTML>` with a semantic syntax, followed from the majority of
basics of `CSS`, like displays as 'Flexbox' and 'Grid', transformations,
transitions and also I applied design concepts like `mobile first` and
`responisve design`.

### And where is the JavaScript? 

Well, I invite to you to check my personal project to figure outh hehe o(*￣▽￣*)ブ
